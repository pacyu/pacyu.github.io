I don't know what TF political is, but if the policy is just against the type of people like me, I'll think it's so stupid, the most of which adults who voiced to support it are failed in whose first the half of life, and maybe that's still keeping on. They think just like "oh, I had failed just because I was addicted to games or animes or whatever.". So they think they caught the point of why they failed, then just educating the next generation with its failure experience.

In my view, I think there has a balance between interest/entertainment and learning. It's not good to overdo anything in bad aspects, that's called Addicted. The game has a bad side, but at the same time, it also could training people's willpower and independent learning ability. As an adult, we should correctly guide children to realize that fascinated in a thing is very enjoyable. We will gain valuable experience from it, instead of being restricted or banned by the damn policy. They just want to leave their responsibility as adults to policy to save trouble.

Well, I didn't mean that all are adults' fault. There are so many problems to solve in China. The company system is bad, and work is so hard that adults have no time to care for their children. Although the government announces a restricting policy, minors will still be addicted to other things in other ways. So, it looks like we are in a circular kind of situation. That's why there are many complaints in China.

Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English.
